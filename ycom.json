  "long_description": "Attain is a one-stop shop for convenience store owners to buy inventory across all their suppliers with higher reliability, price transparency, and product discovery.\r\n\nOn average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler’s sales representatives (who sometimes don’t even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely.\r\n\nAttain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.\r\n\nFeel free to reach out at founders@joinattain.com!",

Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",

Our agents autonomously ingest knowledge, measure performance, and self-correct by refining internal reward models.\r\n\nAt the core of our technology is the Mission Control Engine, specifically designed for reliability and compliance:\r\n- User simulations for pre-launch assurance of agent performance.\r\n- Contextual compliance, with AI models trained directly on mandated regulations, eliminating liabilities from unauthorized advice or mishandled complaints.\r\n- Comprehensive audit trails that document and clearly explain AI decision-making to regulators.\r\n\nBuilt for compliance and trust, Eloquent AI transforms AI from a potential liability into a strategic advantage for financial institutions and healthcare organizations.",

We first launched an opioid product to support government and public health officials in responding to the opioid epidemic, and in 2020 launched a Covid19 product to estimate the scope and trend of the outbreak in communities. We have operated in almost 500 communities across 43 U.S. states, generating Covid19 case estimates for over 13% of the U.S. population.\r\n\nBattling the opioid epidemic and now the Covid19 pandemic is just the beginning - we’re transforming sewage into a data asset and building a public health database. Eventually, Biobot data will be an early warning system for disease outbreaks, a map of nutrition disparities, and more.\r\n\nPlease visit our website at www.biobot.io",

Conversely, over the past decade, currency depreciation across the region has become unsustainable.

Breakeven fusion is coming soon, but the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors will be costly, high maintenance, and have low capacity factors, leading to 5–10x higher electricity cost on the grid. Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials – unlike fission – we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy. Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.",

  "long_description": "careCycle is an AI workforce for medicare agencies and FMOs - helping leading agencies achieve 5x higher conversions, 37% better retention, and saving thousands of agent hours.\r\n\nWe're transforming how Medicare agencies handle member relationships with teams of voice AI agents. We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year. By solving the member retention challenge, we're positioning ourselves to capture significant value by transforming the member care experience for beneficiaries.",

Our investigation revealed that most HOA management companies are outdated mom-and-pop operations nearing retirement, resistant to adopting new technology. Furthermore, these companies often prioritize relationships with vendors and banks over the interests of the communities they serve, leading to misaligned incentives. Realizing this, we knew that to achieve our mission of fixing HOAs, Assembly HOA had to be vertically integrated.\r\n\nWe are live with over 39 communities in Greater Los Angeles and SF Bay Area.",

Most of this treatment is funded by governments, and goes to programs that are frequently predatory, and focus more on profit than people.\r\n\nWe have created an effective, accessible, and affordable solution: Recover. We offer a proven approach using medication and counseling, that can improve outcomes for over 70% of patients. It reduces overdoses by 80%, death by 50%, and has years of research and application showing it works. \r\n\nDespite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs.\r\n\nNick founded Recover after seeing his family and friends struggle with addiction. He was raised by a drug addict, has an alcoholic brother, and lost an uncle to heroin. He saw how hard it is for people to get the treatment they need, and how ineffective existing options are. We are working to make sure that people like Nick’s family have access to best-in-class addiction treatment so they can get and stay well.",

This enables us to prove the value of the rest of the agents on our roadmap.\r\n\nSince launching last summer, we’ve reduced onboarding times by 50% at several of the world’s largest outsourced contact centres/BPOs like PartnerHero and Tech Mahindra, and improved go-live CSAT at Crypto.com by 3% (now above 90% CSAT).",

It's used in automotive manufacturing, aerospace, consumer goods, defense, and many more verticals. The industry mostly operates the same way it has for the last 50+ years.\r\n\nWe're making a 10x better experience for people to get sheet metal parts manufactured. We are vertically integrated and build everything from our quoting engine to the physical automation inside of our factory. Factories should own automation as a core in-house skill. \r\n\nToday we sell laser cut and bent sheet metal parts. Users can get instant quotes through our website (and eventually through integrations build on top of our API). We build custom internal software to command and control the operations of the factory. \r\n\nRight now we are actively working on fully automating the production of laser cut parts including scheduling, material movement, laser configuration, etc. Orders will be able to come in, and our software will control the factory and output parts ready to ship.",

When chemists make a drug or a material, we help them figure out the best reaction parameters such as temperature, concentration and catalyst.\r\n\nWhen Jan was working at chemical labs, he experienced the struggle of spending weeks guessing reaction conditions. We then started experimenting with ML to speed up the process.\r\n\nNow, as a team of three friends from the University of Cambridge, we’ve spent the last month combining our domain expertise in Computer Science, Machine Learning and Chemistry to develop state of the art models for reaction optimisation.\r\n\nAlthough ML is becoming well established in other fields, current chemical models generalise poorly and require lots of programming experience. We make our models easily accessible to chemists in the lab.\r\n\nFinding the right conditions quickly allows pharmaceutical companies to test more drugs, and finding better optima makes manufacturing process cheaper and more environmentally friendly.",

For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\nWe reduce \r\n\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that’s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

We are live with 400 customers and an ARR of $1.4 million.\r\n\nThe problem: Energy installers are eager to expand their deployment of heat pump and photovoltaic systems, yet they are constrained by inefficient sales, planning, and installation processes.\r\n\nThe solution: Our B2B software integrates CRM, planning, and design tools into a unified platform. This enables SMB installers to drastically cut down the pre-installation phase of home energy projects—from several weeks to just minutes. By leveraging LiDAR for spatial analysis, computer vision for automated assessment, and AI for system recommendations, we streamline the entire workflow. This results in a time reduction of up to 90%, enabling installers to confidently transition to and scale up sustainable home energy solutions.",

  "long_description": "Clarion is building the most advanced AI communication layer for healthcare, enabling clinics overwhelmed by routine calls and messages to finally come up for air. Our multichannel AI agents automate complex workflows end-to-end, freeing staff to focus on patient care. \r\n\nThe reality of healthcare today: clinics miss 30-40% of inbound calls due to staffing shortages, while patients struggle to connect with providers. We've built AI agents that handle scheduling, billing, prescription refills, and more—serving tens of thousands of patients monthly.\r\n\nWe're growing rapidly, serving dozens of customers including virtual care companies, outpatient health systems, and a $5B publicly traded health insurance company. With demand surging and revenue quadrupling in recent months, we're scaling our team.\r\n\nWe are an in-person company based in New York. We've raised $5.3M from Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia (scout), and founders of Ophelia, Medallion, Counsel, Elemy, and Sana. \r\n\nOur clinician-led founding team combines healthcare operations expertise with technical excellence. Dr. Ryan Gallagher, our CEO, is a Stanford/Harvard-trained physician from the founding teams of Two Chairs and Ophelia (YC W20). Jeffrey Lamothe, our CTO, worked on voice AI at Amazon Alexa and led AI/ML projects at Salesforce and Citi.\r\n\nJoin us as we transform healthcare communication. We're creating a future where patients receive faster resolutions, staff are happier, and providers have more time for what matters most: patient care.",

Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint’s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor.

We're not just making collaboration faster—we're crafting it to be the best.\r\n\nToday we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.\r\n\nYet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.\r\n\nAt Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.\r\n\nRight now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!\r\n\nWe're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀\r\n\nOur Products:\r\n\n- Velt Collaboration SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.\r\n- Superflow (https://usesuperflow.com/): JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.\r\n\nWe’re a team of ex-Googlers. We've launched products like Augmented Reality in Google Search & Maps.\r\n\nCome build a better web with us 🚀",

LunaJoy utilizes technology and data science to provide intelligent touchpoints that decrease costs and accelerate outcomes. We are increasing our in-network footprint to provide truly accessible care for all. \r\n\nWomen are twice as likely to experience mental health difficulties. Rates are even higher for women of color and LGBTQ+ folks. Women are 3x more likely to experience sexual, physical, emotional trauma which is a predictor for mental illness. This is just the tip of the iceberg! Physiologically, women experience hormonal fluctuations which make them more vulnerable to mental health issues during times of transition such as puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause. We also face unique stressors as the emotional bedrock of our homes, supporting young families, elderly adults, and a huge part of the workforce. The downstream effects of this gap in care are far-reaching into our ecosystems. Currently, mental health care is expensive, inconvenient, and generalist where a specialized approach is needed. When we attend to women’s mental health, we all shine brighter!",

Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari.\r\nTailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.\r\n\n**The Problem**\r\nIn today's business world, old ERP systems just don't keep up.\r\n\nTheir monolithic architecture makes it difficult for developers to tailor to the specific needs, even though that's what the enterprises want for ERP. \r\n\nAt the same time, legacy ERPs struggle to work well with the variety of cloud-based tools that modern businesses rely on.\r\n\nLegacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.\r\n\nBuilding on these challenges, users of old ERP systems often face:\r\n* Hard-to-Use Interfaces: The screens and menus are old school... confusing, slowing down your work.\r\n* Wrong Set of Features: Too many unnecessary options for you and not enough of what you actually need.\r\n* Lack of Transparency: It's tough to understand what's happening behind the scenes.\r\n* High Cost: The expense of maintaining these systems eats into your budget.\r\n\n**The Solution**\r\n\nWhy Headless?\r\n\n- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients\r\n- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services\r\n\nWhat does it mean to our clients?\r\n\n- Faster development\r\n- Reduced maintenance cost\r\n- Well-documented backend APIs\r\n\nTailor’s key capabilities:\r\n\n- GraphQL endpoint for flexible frontend development\r\n- Customizable data model templates to describe complex business logic of large enterprises\r\n- Customizable workflows depending on the client's specific business process\r\n- Directory service that can reflect complex organizational structure (e.g. matrix organization) to the workflow",

  "short_description": "Life's better without allergies",
  "long_description": "Wyndly (https://www.wyndly.com) fixes allergies by training patients' bodies to ignore their allergy triggers. Frustrated allergy suffers come to us when they no longer want to deal with pills and sprays. We diagnose the patient’s unique allergy profile and create a personalized treatment plan to give the patient lifelong allergy relief. Specifically, Wyndly is increasing access to  sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergy care. For our patients, we're combining the convenience of telehealth and direct-to-consumer care with an exceptional patient experience that never loses the context of care.\r\n\nWyndly represents an opportunity to change allergy care forever. With 60 million Americans suffering from allergies today, and with this number doubling over the coming years, there's simply an incredible need for the convenient care Wyndly provides. \r\n\nYou can read more about us in [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/wyndly-aims-to-bring-allergy-drops-to-the-masses/).\r\n\nThe Wyndly Model \r\n\nAt Wyndly, we believe that better connections lead to better care, and we’re committed to making both happen at every step of the patient journey. Our allergy practice allows our patients to work with expert providers to develop personalized treatment plans for long-term allergy relief using clinically proven therapies. From a patient’s initial consultation to their final treatment delivery, we want the Wyndly experience to be a breath of fresh air for allergy sufferers – truly effective allergy relief, simply and efficiently delivered.\r\n\nOnce we've conquered allergies, we're transforming the care model for every chronic condition. While transactional care for purchasing pills has flourished in telehealth, no one has gone after chronic care. Patients with chronic conditions are shuffled between providers, insurance, and more -- and they never feel heard. These patients deserve better, and we're going to give it to them. Wyndly is starting with allergies, but we'll expand into asthma, sleep apnea, and other conditions in the near future.\r\n\nOur values\r\n\n**Compassion**: We approach all our patients and partners with an open mind and a genuine desire to be of service.\r\n\n**Focus**: We do a few things very well, and are always clear about our boundaries and direction of travel.\r\n\n**Courage**: We embrace ambiguity and discomfort because we know that’s how we grow.\r\n\n**Progress**: We make something better every single day.\r\n\n*It boils down to empathy and forward momentum in everything we do.*\r\n\nThe team\r\n\nWyndly is proudly backed by Y Combinator and a leading group of angel investors and VCs. The founders are Dr. Manan Shah (Chief Medical Officer), an ear-nose-and-throat surgeon who’s a leading practitioner of telehealth in his specialty, and his cousin Aakash Shah (CEO), who led growth  engineering at SparkGift (acquired by Stockpile in 2016) and Parse.ly (acquired by Automattic in 2021).",

Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 60% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\n## Fun Fact\r\n\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.\r\n\n- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.\r\n- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.\r\n- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.",

Agents are the largest insurance distribution channel in India and cover 85% of the premium collection. \r\n\nAgents collect 20B premium every year. With a 5% take rate, it’s a 1B dollar market opportunity growing at 22% CAGR.\r\n\nKunal has 15+ years of experience working with insurance companies and building agent networks, while he scaled his brokerage business to 3M dollars in revenue. Rachit has 12+ years of experience in building tech products, he was a founding engineer at Payu (stripe of India).",

Our breakthrough Omnivore propulsion system can propel spacecraft, including our Worker Bee commercial OTV with water or virtually any other fluid as a propellant using only concentrated sunlight as a power source. Omnivore is faster, cheaper, and more practical than electric propulsion while being substantially less expensive, safer, and more operationally flexible than legacy chemical propulsion systems. Our Sutter Telescope System can identify and locate resource-rich asteroids and orbital debris that existing technologies can’t find and works synergistically with our Worker Bee OTV for orbital logistics. For government customers, Sutter can identify dark fast-moving objects between Earth and the Moon which currently evade detection, a critical issue for national defense and a key need of the Space Force. We are already using Sutter in ground-based observatories and will begin commercial sales of Sutter SDA data next month having tracked dozens of faint moving objects in space already. Once launched into space, Sutter will be 300,000 times more cost effective than any other known telescope design and will revolutionize sense making in space.",

It's a $100B dollar-problem in the US alone - and every year up to 50% of the truck space in the country goes empty.\r\n\nWith trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and carriers alike. For carriers, integrating Oway can immediately increase annual revenues by up to 30% with almost no impact to existing delivery schedules.\r\n\nIn a technical sense, Oway applies stochastic spread optimization and real-time liquidity modeling to dynamically price freight shipments, effectively functioning as a decentralized market maker optimizing expected value across variable supply constraints. We wrap all of this under a beautiful, simple package for both businesses and carriers - allowing anyone to reap the benefits of rideshare freight shipping with the click of a button.",
